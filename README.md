need postgres. currently only runs locally and on crunchyroll. other sites under experimentation.

* must install [the crunchyroll html5er](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crunchyroll-html5/ihegfgnkffeibpmnajnoiemkcmlbmhmi)
* must have postgres and flask. change database location in server/dev_config.py accordingly
* you can go to localhost://5000/admin to easily see all changes made to db.

### to run
* run server/run.py to run the server. and link the extension folder to dev mode extensions
